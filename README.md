Console-Chess C++ game, fully-playable pvp 1vs1 on the console. The code right now only works in Windows.

For explanation of the code, see the report:

Note the report states the code does not implement "check" because it was written before it was actually implemented. The code implements "check", "checkmate" and "stalemate".
