Console-Chess C++ game, fully-playable pvp 1vs1 on the console. The code currently only works on Windows.

For explanation of the code, see the report:

Note the report states the code does not implement "check". However, that is because it was written before it was actually implemented. The code does implement "check", "checkmate" and "stalemate".

All the code was written between March and June 2020
